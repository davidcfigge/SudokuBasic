Sudoku Basic
David Figge

-- Origins -- 

I wrote this code in 2010 or as an opportunity to learn about Objective C and general coding in
the iOS environment. If I recall correctly, we were working in iOS 4 at the time. Although I have
updated the code to adapt to changes in the OS over the years (yes, the program still runs under
the current iOS version), it has not been updated to include newer more efficient iOS APIs (other
that APIs that were deprecated or removed and stopped the app from working properly).

This app basically allows you to build a randomly generated Sudoku board of varying skill levels
and solve the puzzle. It supports pencil markings (auto and manual) and has an extensive help
system (including lessons on how to become better at playing Sudoku).

So you shouldn't take this code to be a recent example of code that I write, but it can be used to
as an example of the STYLE of code that I write. This is code for my own use, and was not
intended for public consumption. The source code you see is the way I like to write my source code.
My intent was to write the code in clear and flexible ways so that it was easy to understand what
the code is doing years later as I needed to maintain and/or add to it.

I have not submitted this app to the app store. Not because it isn't "good enough" (many people
have suggested that I should), but solely because my ability to differentiate my app from the
plethora of Sudoku apps out there is limited, and it simply isn't reason to believe that I would make
even enough money to cover the expenses of distribution and support of the app.
